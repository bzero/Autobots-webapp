<h5>Advanced Order Types</h5>
<div class="divider" style="margin-bottom:30px;"></div>

<p>Please take extra care when using advanced and algorithmic orders. These orders are complex, and the results might not be immediately apparent as some of them may execute and settle over time. They may execute based on options defined by the user as well as on market conditions.</p>

<p>Due to the complex nature of these order types, they are not enabled by default. By clicking "I Agree," below, you confirm that you understand these orders, their complexity, and agree to take the risk involved.</p>
